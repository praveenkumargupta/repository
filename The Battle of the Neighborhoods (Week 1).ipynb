This report will provide recommendation to the stakeholders interested in opening a **restaurant** in **Bangalore**, India.\n\nAs part of this analysis, I will try to find **locations with low density of restaurants** and which are **close to city**.\n\nwe will utilize data science to find few neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
